## üìñ Project Description

This project is a **MERN Stack CRUD Application** built using **MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js, and Tailwind CSS**.  
It demonstrates the complete implementation of **Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD)** operations for efficient data management with a clean and responsive interface.

The **backend** is powered by **Express.js** and **Node.js**, providing RESTful APIs connected to a **MongoDB** database for handling all data operations.  
The **frontend** is developed using **React.js**, styled with **Tailwind CSS**, ensuring a modern, mobile-friendly, and visually appealing user experience.
